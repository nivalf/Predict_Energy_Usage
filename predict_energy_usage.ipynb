        "The household electric energy consumption is highly correlated to air temperature, moderately correlated to precipitation and duration of sunshine [1].\n",
        "\n",
        "When the daily temperature rises, the daily electricity demand falls [2]. The decline in demand as the temperature rises could be attributed to a number of factors, including an increase in outside activity and a decrease in the need for heating [1]. However, it is interesting to note that this pattern isn’t essentially true from late night hours to early morning time. This is because the people would be resting during this time. The electricity usage shows high sensitivity to temperature during the day time and early night time [1].\n",
        "\n",
        "Given that individuals are less inclined to go outside when it rains more heavily, more rainfall may be related to higher electricity demand. As in the case of temperature, rain doesn’t have much effect on the energy consumption during late nights and early mornings for the same reasons [1].\n",
        "\n",
        "People tend to engage in more outdoor activities during sunny days leading to a reduction in the household energy consumption. However a clear pattern is observed before and after the time 15:00. It can be explained as more indoor activities might take place from morning to around 15:00 and later people get engaged in outdoor activities [1] [3] [4].\n",
        "\n",
        "The daytime till late-night demand for power is increased by relative humidity and wind speed. This pattern is similar to that of temperature. However, all the effects of humidity and wind speed are relatively insignificant [1].\n",
        "\n",
        "The energy consumption during weekends follow a different pattern than weekdays. This could be because people spend more time at house rather than office during weekends and the activities during weekend vary considerably from that of weekdays [1]. \n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, temperature, precipitation and duration of sunshine are major factors for deciding energy consumption whereas humidity and wind speed has very small influence [1]. However, the humidity and wind speed can be combined with temperature to get apparent temperature which is the perceived temperature in degrees Fahrenheit for the specified hour determined by either a combination of temperature and wind (Wind Chill) or by a combination of temperature and humidity (Heat Index). The wind chill factor will be applied to a grid point’s apparent temperature when the outside temperature drops to 50 F or less at that location. The heat index will be utilised for Apparent Temperature whenever a grid point’s temperature exceeds 80 F. The ambient air temperature is represented as the\n",
        "apparent temperature between 51 and 80 F [5].\n",
        "\n",
        "A solar panel attached to a house can generate a fair amount of energy at suitable environmental conditions. Even while solar energy can still be captured on cloudy and rainy days, the solar panel’s energy generation effectiveness is reduced. Sunlight is necessary for solar panels to efficiently collect solar energy. As a result, a few days of cloudy, rainy weather can significantly affect the energy grid. Furthermore, higher temperature doesn’t necessarily mean higher energy generation. Solar panels\n",
